# Open Source Custom IC Creator packages

This is a collection of open source circuit libraries that can be used
as building blocks for more complex cells.

## Warning
As of 2018-04-08 this is still an unstable reposotory,  mainly
because I have not decided how I want to organize the files, which
means the repository keeps changing.

## Contribute
Feel free to ask for access to the repository, I'd be happy to accept pull-requests.
